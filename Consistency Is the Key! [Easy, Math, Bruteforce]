Problem Statement: 
-----------------

A long, long time ago, there lived a hare in the forest who always boasted of his running speed. He would often tease the tortoise for 
being the slowest animal around. One fine day, he dared the tortoise to a race in order to exhibit his skills in front of other animals in the forest. 
Fed up with the hare’s bragging, the tortoise finally accepted the challenge and decided to compete him in a race.

The hare has a serious procrastination factor. After each second, its speed decreases by half. That means if initially its speed is 1m/s, 
then in the 1st second it will cross 1 meter, in the 2nd second it will cross 0.5 meters and so on. On the other hand, the tortoise’s speed remains 
constant.

You’re given the initial speed of the hare and the tortoise. You have to find the minimum integer number of seconds needed for the tortoise to beat 
the hare.

Input: 
-----
Input will start with a single integer T (1<=T<=10^6), denoting the number of test cases. 
Each test case will contain two space-separated integers x (x=2^p; p is an integer in range [0, 50]) and y (1<=y<=10^16), 
the hare and the tortoise’s initial speed (in meters per second).

Output: 
-------
For each test case, print the case number at the first line as "Case t:" where t is the test case number, 
followed by the only one integer value: the minimum integer number of seconds needed for the tortoise to beat the hare.

Sample Input:
------------
4
2 1
4 3 
2 2
4 5   
Sample Output:
--------------
Case #1: 4
Case #2: 3
Case #3: 2
Case #4: 1

Explanation:
------------
In the first test case, after 4 seconds, the hare’s position is (2 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.25) = 3.75 meters and 
the tortoise’s position is (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 4 meters. The tortoise cannot beat the hare in 3 or fewer seconds.

In the third test case, after 1 second, both are equal in position, which is 2 meters. After 2 seconds, 
the hare’s position is (2 + 1) = 3 meters. The tortoise’s position is (2 + 2) = 4 meters.
