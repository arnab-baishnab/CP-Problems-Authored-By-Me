## Description

Toaka, a Japanese singer, visited a park with a single road lined with large flower trees on one side and a river on the other. The trees are numbered from `1` to `N`, and the distance between any two adjacent trees is one meter. The trees have magical properties:

- Every `x_i` minutes, a flower of color `c_i` falls from the `i-th` tree. You can assume that there are enough regenerating flowers, and the time it takes for a flower to fall to the ground is zero. Toaka must pick the flower exactly every `x_i-th` minute.

Toaka has a limited amount of time (`T` minutes) to pick flowers, but her basket has unlimited capacity. She starts at the entrance of the park, which is 1 meter before the first tree. It takes her `|i - j|` minutes to move from the `i-th` tree to the `j-th` tree. She can also choose to stay in the same place at any minute.

Toaka loves variety and wants to collect as many **different colors** of flowers as possible. Your task is to determine the **maximum number of distinct colors** she can gather by moving optimally within the given time.

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains two integers `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and `T` (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), the number of trees and the total time Toaka has.
  - The second line contains `N` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_N` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 100), the time intervals at which flowers fall from each tree.
  - The third line contains `N` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_N` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10), the colors of the flowers generated by each tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of `N` over all test cases does not exceed `100`.

## Output

For each test case, print `"Case t: answer"`, where `t` is the test case number, followed by the maximum number of distinct colors Toaka can collect.

## Sample Input

```
1
7 100
5 5 5 3 6 3 5
7 5 5 1 6 4 5
```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 5
```

---

## Explanation

### First Sample Input
Toaka has enough time to collect at least one flower of all colors (`7, 5, 1, 6, 4`). Thus, the maximum number of distinct colors she can gather is `5`.

## Sample Input 2

```
2
7 10
5 3 6 10 10 6 7
5 4 10 7 7 6 6
7 10
3 8 7 5 10 4 7
5 6 7 7 2 5 6
```

## Sample Output 2

```
Case 1: 3
Case 2: 3
```

---

## Explanation

### First Test Case
Toaka can collect a set of three distinct colors (`5, 4, 10`) at the `10-th`, `3-rd`, and `6-th` minutes. Alternatively, she can gather another set of three distinct colors (`4, 10, 7`) at the `3-rd`, `6-th`, and `10-th` minutes. It is impossible to collect more than `3` distinct colors.

### Second Test Case
Toaka can collect a set of three distinct colors (`7, 2, 5`) at the `5-th`, `10-th`, and `8-th` minutes. Alternatively, she can gather another set of three distinct colors (`5, 6, 7`) at the `3-rd`, `8-th`, and `7-th` minutes. It is impossible to collect more than `3` distinct colors.
